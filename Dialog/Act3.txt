* Pre-order
A: Hey, welcome back. Good to see you
S: Hey, man
S: How are things?
A: They've been good, thanks. Lovely night for a coffee, can I get you something to start?
S: Sure, yeah. Black coffee, as is
A: Of course, coming right up

* Post-order
A: No sugar or cream today?
S: Nah. I think the taste of black coffee is starting to grow on me actually
A: Maybe it was the cognative shift away from thinking about it as a source of pain?
S: Something like that, I guess.

S: Hey, I've been meaning to ask. What's the story about that bonsai you keep on the counter?
A: Oh that? It was a gift, from another customer.
S: Ahh I see. I see...
S: Hey, you ever see any of those old world war 2 movies?
S: bonSAIIIIII~
A: Can't say I'm familiar
A: Is this some anime thing I'm not getting?
S: Haha, nah, don't worry about it
S: Speaking of anime, thanks for holding on to my drawing tablet for me
S: Didn't mean to leave it behind. Only realized it was missing when I was halfway home
A: Of course, no worries.
S: But, this was a blessing in disguise~
A: Oh?
S: Yep~
S: Since I literally couldn't draw last night, I decided to try again at taking a break
S: I was feeling super guilty about not doing any work, but every time I had those thoughts, I reminded myself that it was out of my hands
S: I mean, the cafe was closed, so it's not like I could go get it or anything
S: It was tough, but I eventually managed to relax and take the night off~
A: Very nice, I'm proud of you!
S: Thanks, Arthur.
S: So, I'm ready to get back to work today. Feeling refreshed, and ready to create~
A: That's great to hear, Sam.
A: And how are you feeling about your workload? You've got quite a lot of work ahead of you
S: Yeah, that's true.
