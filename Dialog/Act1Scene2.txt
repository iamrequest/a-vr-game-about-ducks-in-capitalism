* Order dialog
W: (grumbles)
P: You look tired. What can I get you?
W: A nap would be nice. You think I can take a nap behind the counter?
P: It probably wouldn't be sanitary
W: You sure? I've got a sleeping bag back at the office, I could bring it by
W: Maybe roast some marshmallows over the coffee burner, have us some smores~
W: Maybe build a fort out of some blankies, and tell each-other about our crushes???
P: That's tempting, but I'll have to pass tonight
P: Maybe take me out to dinner first~
W: Haha sure sure, I'll hold you to it then
W: I guess for now, I'll start with a coffee
P: Sure thing. How do you take it?
W: Let's see... I'll take my coffee with cream, and 7 sugars tonight
P: Cream and 7 sugars? S-sure, coming right up
W: ?

* Post-order
P: So, do you think the whole marshmallow thing would actually work?
W: What, roasting smores over the coffee burner?
W: Yeah! Those get pretty hot, right?
P: I mean, yeah. But it's probably not hot enough to cook a marhshmallow without contact
W: But~ If you had some tin foil, you've essentially got a frying pan
W: And that toasts them up pretty nicely~
P: Sounds like you're speaking from experience
W: That's university life, my guy
P: Fair enough
W: It's not just good for marshmallows ya know.
W: You can also cook canned soups, and ramen with a coffee maker.
W: And even pancakes~
W: Honestly, who even needs a frying pan these days?
P: I mean, you're welcome to get rid of yours, but I wouldn't wanna give up having multiple burners
W: So? Just get 4 coffee pots. Bam, you've got a full range stovetop
P: ...
P: 4 coffee pots at the same time DOES sound nice...

* Loop
S: How's that coffee coming along? Getting sleepy over here my guy
P: It's on the way, shouldn't be much longer.

* Eval
S: Ah, thanks
S: ...

* Fail
P: Something wrong?
S: This tastes like shit, bud
P: Ah, my bad. Let me re-make it for you

* Success
W: Mmm, just what I needed
W: This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee
P: You sure about that? It's mostly cream and sugar.
P: I mean, you do you, but this coffee is some serious gourmet shit. 
W: This is how I like my coffee, my guy. I've always had my coffee like this
P: When did you start drinking your coffee like this?
W: Earlier this year.
W: The coffee at work is hot garbage, it's the only way to really drink the stuff
W: The boss orders whatever dirt passes as coffee, just to save a few cents.
W: Pretty sure he mixes actual sawdust in with their coffee grinds to dilute it...
P: Greasy. You do what you can in a pinch, huh?
W: Yep. Work's been getting real busy lately, so it's not like I can slip out for better coffee
W: But that's life, ya know?
W: Besides, I'm used to it now. I drink a bunch of the stuff these days
P:
